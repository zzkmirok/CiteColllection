ABSTRACT = {Within the context of flexible parametric families of distributions, much work has been dedicated in recent years to the theme of skew-symmetric distributions, or symmetry-modulated distributions, as we prefer to call them. The present contribution constitutes a review of this area, with special emphasis on multivariate skew-elliptical families, which represent the subset with more immediate impact on applications. After providing background information of the distribution theory aspects, we focus on the aspects more relevant for applied work. The exposition is targeted to non-specialists in this domain, although some general knowledge of probability and multivariate statistics is assumed. Given this aim, the mathematical profile is kept to the minimum required.},

abstract = {Abstract A sample of 35 independent molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of calmodulin (CaM) equilibrium dynamics was prepared from different but equally plausible initial conditions (20 simulations of the wild-type protein and 15 simulations of the D129N mutant). CaM's radius of gyration and backbone mean-square fluctuations were analyzed for the effect of the D129N mutation, and simulations were compared with experiments. Statistical tests were employed for quantitative comparisons at the desired error level. The computational model predicted statistically significant compaction of CaM relative to the crystal structure, consistent with the results of small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) experiments. This effect was not observed in several previously reported studies of (Ca2+)4-CaM, which relied on a single MD run. In contrast to radius of gyration, backbone mean-square fluctuations showed a distinctly non-normal and positively skewed distribution for nearly all residues. Furthermore, the D129N mutation affected the backbone dynamics in a complex manner and reduced the mobility of Glu123, Met124, Ile125, Arg126, and Glu127 located in the adjacent α-helix G. The implications of these observations for the comparisons of MD simulations with experiments are discussed. The proposed approach may be useful in studies of protein equilibrium dynamics where MD simulations fall short of properly sampling the conformational space, and when the comparison with experiments is affected by the reproducibility of the computational model.},

abstract = {Two new anharmonic forms for the Debye{--}Waller factor, aimed at modelling curvilinear and asymmetric motion, have been introduced. These forms permit the refinement of structures with these types of anharmonic motion using a small number of additional parameters. Molecular-dynamics-derived numerical probability density functions (PDFs) have been used to assess the merit of these new functions in real space. The comparison is favourable particularly for the curvilinear PDF based on a parabolic coordinate system change of a trivariate Gaussian distribution. The initial results also suggest that high-order even terms from the Gram{--}Charlier series may be important for modelling methyl-group libration. The molecular-dynamics data sets provide useful insights into the nature of anharmonic thermal motion. Addressing the problem in real space allows intuitive PDFs to be developed but numerical methods may be necessary for these methods to be implemented in refinement programs as an analytical Debye{--}Waller factor cannot always be obtained.},

    abstract = "{Skew-normal and skew-t distributions have proved to be useful for capturing skewness and kurtosis in data directly without transformation. Recently, finite mixtures of such distributions have been considered as a more general tool for handling heterogeneous data involving asymmetric behaviors across subpopulations. We consider such mixture models for both univariate as well as multivariate data. This allows robust modeling of high-dimensional multimodal and asymmetric data generated by popular biotechnological platforms such as flow cytometry.We develop Bayesian inference based on data augmentation and Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling. In addition to the latent allocations, data augmentation is based on a stochastic representation of the skew-normal distribution in terms of a random-effects model with truncated normal random effects. For finite mixtures of skew normals, this leads to a Gibbs sampling scheme that draws from standard densities only. This MCMC scheme is extended to mixtures of skew-t distributions based on representing the skew-t distribution as a scale mixture of skew normals.As an important application of our new method, we demonstrate how it provides a new computational framework for automated analysis of high-dimensional flow cytometric data. Using multivariate skew-normal and skew-t mixture models, we could model non-Gaussian cell populations rigorously and directly without transformation or projection to lower dimensions.}",

abstract = {Solute segregation at grain boundaries (GBs) is emerging as an alloy design tool, uses of which include the stabilization of nanocrystalline alloys. To predict the equilibrium segregation state in a given alloy, most thermodynamic models treat the full network of GBs as a single “entity”, and thus use an “effective” segregation energy to describe it. This simplification ignores the spectral nature of available GB segregation energies in a polycrystal, which we elucidate here computationally for a Mg solute in an Al polycrystal; the distribution is found to be captured accurately with a skew-normal function. A thermodynamic segregation isotherm that incorporates this spectrum is outlined and employed to study the effect of such a spectrum on predictions of the equilibrium GB segregation state. The ramifications for experimentally-extracted GB segregation energies are shown to be potentially significant, and nanocrystalline stability criteria are extended to account for this spectral nature of GB segregation.}
